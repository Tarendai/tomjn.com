#tomjn.com Theme

This is the theme for my personal website, but I intend it to be flexible
enough for general usage oneday. Some functionality requires private plugins,
but will be disabled if they're not present.

## Installation

Install as any normal theme, but, before doing so add this plugin:

https://github.com/sanchothefat/wp-less

There is a WP-LESS plugin on the WordPress.org repository, but it is not
the same plugin despite sharing the same name. Without this plugin, the theme
styling will not work correctly.
